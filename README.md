With this practice I learned how to use typescript with javascript and react by building a normal interaective web page for travellers. 

The user would be able to see and explore their travel options and be able to choose and the server will ve notified. 

this project was a good practice for people who wnats too explore react and typescript.

The video and the project comes from the youtuber Mosh Hamedani, defintely go and check him out.

I promise to be uploading and doing more projects like this, and also working on learning and using more tools like tableau, tensorflow, terraform, GO, Bash, and pipelines. I have started a little bit hope fully terra form and GO will be on my target to learn and implement them in my projects. I also need to learn tableau and how to integrate mysql databases.
i have to learn rust and golang
